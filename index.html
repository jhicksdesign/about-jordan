                <h1>All About Jordan</h1>
                <p>Hello, my name is Jordan, and I recently moved to Albuquerque about a year ago. Previously I lived in St. Louis,
                Missouri for about 4 years, and before that I lived in Sarasota, Florida. I have a DOGGO named Astrid, she's 10
                months old and takes up a ton of my free time. Outside of spending time taking care of and playing with my DOGGO I play
                a lot of video games, Path of Exile being one that has taken up most of my time recently. I have an associates in web design
                and I am taking this course to hopefully further my
                professional development.</p>
